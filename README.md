## ✨ Features (v0.1.0)

- **⚡ Instant uploads**  
  Drag & drop or click to upload — no accounts required.

- **🍪 Anonymous user tracking**  
  Users are tracked via a unique cookie-based ID. No logins, no emails, just simple usage.

- **📎 Clean short URLs**  
  Each image gets a root-level short URL like `https://yourdomain.com/abc1234.jpg`  
  (actual folder structure stays hidden).

- **🖼️ Auto gallery**  
  Shows uploaded images that still exist — nothing broken or stale.

- **📋 Copy & 🗑️ Delete controls**  
  Each image has a full URL text field, copy button, and a delete button.

- **🌗 Light/Dark theme toggle**  
  Toggle between dark and light UI modes. Theme preference is saved and restored on return visits.

- **📅 Dynamic footer**  
  Automatically displays the site title and year, with GitHub project credits.
